## **Assignment: Bano Qabil Recipes Website**

The goal of this assignment is to practice basic HTML structure, file organization, links, and lists. Do not worry about design or styling yet. Focus only on correctness and structure.

## **Iteration 1: Initial Structure**

1. Create a folder named Bano-Qabil-recipes.  
2. Inside this folder, create a file named index.html.  
3. Add standard HTML boilerplate code.  
4. Inside the \<body\>, add the following heading:  
    \<h1\>Bano Qabil Recipes\</h1\>

## **Iteration 2: First Recipe Page**

1. Inside Bano-Qabil-recipes, create a new folder named recipes.  
2. Inside the recipes folder, create a new HTML file named after a recipe, for example:  
    biryani.html  
3. Add standard HTML boilerplate code to this file.  
4. Inside the \<body\>, add an \<h1\> with the recipe name.

### **Linking Pages**

Open index.html and add a link to the recipe page:  
 \<a href="recipes/biryani.html"\>Biryani\</a\>  
Open the recipe page and add a link back to the home page:  
 \<a href="../index.html"\>Home\</a\>

 You may place this link at the top or bottom of the page.  
**Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content**

Each recipe page must contain the following structure, in this order:

1. \<h1\> with the recipe name  
2. An image of the finished dish (use a free image)  
3. A \<h2\> heading titled Description  
4. One or two paragraphs describing the recipe  
5. A \<h2\> heading titled Ingredients  
6. An unordered list (\<ul\>) of ingredients  
7. A \<h2\> heading titled Steps  
8. An ordered list (\<ol\>) of cooking steps

Do not add styling. Focus only on structure and correct HTML.

## **Iteration 4: Add More Recipes**

1. Create **two more recipe pages** inside the recipes folder.  
2. Each recipe page must follow the **exact same structure**.  
3. Update index.html to include links to all recipes.

Wrap all recipe links inside an unordered list:  
 \<ul\>  
  \<li\>\<a href="recipes/recipe1.html"\>Recipe 1\</a\>\</li\>  
  \<li\>\<a href="recipes/recipe2.html"\>Recipe 2\</a\>\</li\>  
  \<li\>\<a href="recipes/recipe3.html"\>Recipe 3\</a\>\</li\>  
\</ul\>

## **Viewing Your Project on the Web (GitHub Pages)**

To share your project online:

1. Make sure your main file is named index.html.  
2. Push your project to a **public** GitHub repository.  
3. Open your repository on GitHub.  
4. Go to **Settings → Pages**.  
5. Under **Source**, select:  
   * Branch: main  
6. Click **Save**.  
7. Wait a few minutes.

Your site will be available at:  
 https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name

### **If the site does not appear:**

* Confirm index.html exists in the root folder.  
* Recheck Pages settings.  
* Toggle branch selection if needed and wait again.

## **Important Expectations**

* Your project does **not** need to look impressive.  
* Do **not** compare your work to advanced submissions.  
* Focus on meeting the requirements correctly.  
* Clean structure matters more than appearance.

This assignment is about learning fundamentals, not perfection.
