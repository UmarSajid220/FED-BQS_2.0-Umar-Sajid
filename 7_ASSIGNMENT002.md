### **Assignment: Build a Web Page from a Design**

In this assignment, you will create a complete static web page using **HTML and CSS** based on a provided design. You are not given step-by-step instructions on how to build it. The goal is to practice turning a visual design into real code using the skills you have already learned.

### **What You Are Given**

 • Two design images  
 • One image showing the complete website layout  
 • One image showing font and color details

### **Your Objective**

• Recreate the given design using HTML and CSS  
 • Focus on structure, layout, and positioning  
 • Aim for visual similarity, not pixel perfection

### **How to Approach the Project**

 • Work section by section  
 • Start from the top of the page and move downward  
 • Add all HTML content first  
 • Apply CSS styling after the structure is complete  
 • Use a single CSS file for the project  
 • Refer back to previous lessons when needed  
 • Use Google to look up unfamiliar properties

### **Important Guidelines**

 • Do not aim for pixel-perfect accuracy  
 • Exact spacing and measurements are not required  
 • Approximate values are acceptable  
 • The page does not need to be responsive  
 • Focus only on desktop layout  
 • Feel free to customize text, images, colors, or fonts

### **Images and Copyright**

 • Do not use random images from the internet  
 • Use free-to-use images only  
 • Credit image creators in a README file  
 • Recommended image sources  
 • Pexels  
 • Pixabay  
 • Unsplash

### **Git and GitHub Setup**

 • Create a Git repository before starting  
 • Commit early and commit often  
 • Push all work to GitHub  
 • Use GitHub as your project portfolio

### **Publishing Your Project**

 • Deploy the project using GitHub Pages  
 • Ensure the main file is named index.html  
 • Follow the same deployment steps used in the Recipes project

### **Expectations**

 • Your project does not need to look advanced  
 • Do not compare your work with experienced developers  
 • Focus on meeting the requirements correctly  
 • Clean structure matters more than visual polish

### **Final Reminder**

This assignment is designed to help you think like a front-end developer. Take your time, work methodically, and focus on understanding rather than perfection.
